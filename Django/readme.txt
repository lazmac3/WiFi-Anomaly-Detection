This is the source code for a simple endpoint I built in Django. The notebook calls the api creates a user using oAuth and gets a prediction.

I started using the notes from the cloud computing module. I intended to build a dockerfile for this but ran out of time, so it was built in a venv. The dependacies are listed. The SKlear needs to be the version listed (see pippackages.txt). I could imagine numpy causing issues in the future (vertex AI uses slightly older versions) but it worked at the time of submission.
